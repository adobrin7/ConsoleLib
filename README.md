# ConsoleLib

## Idea.

The library proposes to use the concept of dialog menu when interacting with the user of the console interface. This helps to organize the code in a predictable and consistent manner. In some cases, will greatly reduce the number of code lines.

*Additionally, the library provides a set of tools to simplify console interaction with user.*
